/**
 * Dev server proxies every backend path so the browser only ever talks to the
 * Vite origin. Two things fall out of that, and both matter here:
 *
 *  - No CORS. The backend's CORS_ORIGINS lists a fixed set of origins, and the
 *    dev server's port is not one it can know about; a same-origin proxy
 *    sidesteps the negotiation entirely.
 *  - <img src> works against the binary endpoints. Camera snapshots, event
 *    frames and found-item crops are all image/jpeg responses handed straight
 *    to an <img>, which cannot carry headers or answer a preflight.
 *
 * /health sits on the app root rather than under /api/v1, so it needs its own
 * entry -- keep it in step with nginx.conf.template, which proxies the same set
 * in production.
